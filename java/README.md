# Call of 2D Zombies
### A 2D Zombie Survival Game

Call of 2D Zombies is a two-dimensional zombie survival game with an overhead viewpoint. The player can move a character around the screen with keyboard input and aim a weapon with the mouse. Left clicking will fire a weapon in the direction of the mouse pointer. Zombies (squares) come in waves that increase in difficulty. The player has limited health, and each contact with a zombie decreases that health. The playerâ€™s goal is to shoot and kill the zombies, surviving for as long as possible.
